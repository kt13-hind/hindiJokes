# hindiJokes

This project demonstrates the way an express node js application is made. It shows random jokes from an api https://hindi-jokes-api.onrender.com/jokes?api_key=<your_api>. This happens in the front end part. The app is in an initial state, i am hoping to make a full on application with user sign up, login, favorities etc. I will be updating it as possible.
